	\section intro Introduction

	Welcome to the OldSchool Library documentation. To begin, you can access the function reference by clicking on the
	"Modules" tab.

	This page includes some tutorials that you can read before beginning.
	If you are a beginner, it is strongly recommended that you check the official OSLib site: http://oslib.playeradvance.org.

	On this you will be able to find some simple tutorials to begin with. The documentation you are reading is designed for more
	advanced users.

	\section concepts Concepts

	As said before, this documentation is not made for beginners, and you should check the official OSLib site where you will
	be able to find the excellent tutorials made by Yodajr, which are ideal to begin with.

	\page swizzling About image swizzling...

	In the OSLib documentation, you will often hear about a term named "swizzling".

	The image swizzling is a process that reorders the pixels in an image to make it more adapted to the way the graphic
	processor reads it. For more information, please read: http://wiki.ps2dev.org/psp:ge_faq.

	As a result, images are drawn way faster. But the downside is that the pixels are no more contiguous,
	making it harder to modify images, because you can't access a single pixel by its position anymore, but need some quite
	complicated calculation to find the real reordered pixel position on the image.

	So, if you want to access the image data, easily and quickly (for example for an oldschool framebuffered demo), you should
	use unswizzled (normal) images. For images loaded from files that you don't plan to modify later, you should use
	swizzled images, as it's really a lot faster (especially if the image is put in RAM).

	By default, OSLib will automatically swizzle images when loading them from a file (see #oslLoadImageFile).
	But it won't swizzle images created manually (see #oslCreateImage). But you can disable swizzling by passing the
	OSL_UNSWIZZLED flag when loading the image. See #oslSetImageAutoSwizzle.
